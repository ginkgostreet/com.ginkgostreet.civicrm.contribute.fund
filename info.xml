  <description>
    This module tames University Synagogue's contribution page, which allows donors
    to contribute to various funds. The funds are collected in a dropdown
    list, and giving amounts are suggested to donors via a configurable price field.
    (Donors may also enter in a different amount.) Selected funds and associated amounts
    are displayed in a table, which the donor may edit. Admins can direct visitors to a
    specific fund via a URL parameter (e.g., /civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&amp;id=8&amp;fund=50,
    where 50 is the price field ID of the desired fund).

    This module was built specifically for University Synagogue. It's possible the
    customization could have applications for other organizations, but it's unclear
    how much work would be required to make the extension sufficiently generic to
    be reusable.
